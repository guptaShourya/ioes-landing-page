            Canadian business education blends North American and European
            approaches with a distinctive focus on sustainability, ethical
            leadership, and multicultural management. Top institutions include
            the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, McGill's
            Desautels Faculty of Management, Western University's Ivey Business
            School, and Queen's Smith School of Business.

            MBA programs in Canada typically range from 12-20 months, offering
            excellent value compared to US programs while maintaining high
            quality. Canadian business schools emphasize experiential learning
            through case competitions, consulting projects, and co-op work
            terms. Specialized Master's programs in finance, analytics, supply
            chain management, and entrepreneurship provide focused expertise for
            global careers.

            Legal education in Canada reflects the country's bijural tradition,
            combining common law and civil law systems. Most provinces follow
            common law traditions (similar to the UK and US), while Quebec
            operates under civil law (similar to France). Leading law schools
            include the University of Toronto, McGill University, Osgoode Hall
            (York University), and the University of British Columbia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Juris Doctor (JD) is the standard first professional degree,
            typically requiring three years of study after completing an
            undergraduate degree. McGill offers a unique combined civil law and
            common law degree. For international students not seeking Canadian
            practice qualifications, specialized Master of Laws (LLM) programs
            provide advanced training in areas like international law, human
            rights, business law, and environmental law.

            Canadian legal education emphasizes critical thinking, legal
            research, and professional ethics, with opportunities for clinical
            experience through legal clinics serving communities. The country's
            leadership in areas like constitutional rights, indigenous law,
            immigration law, and environmental protection creates distinctive
            contexts for legal study and research.
