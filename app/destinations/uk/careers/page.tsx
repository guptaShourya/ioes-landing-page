            The UK remains a global financial powerhouse, with London's
            financial district hosting international banks, insurance companies,
            investment funds, and financial technology startups. The sector
            offers diverse roles in investment banking, asset management,
            insurance, financial analysis, risk management, and emerging areas
            like sustainable finance and cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p>
            FinTech represents a particularly dynamic segment, with the UK
            leading European investment in digital banking, payment solutions,
            regtech, and insurtech. Major financial institutions and startups
            alike seek professionals combining financial knowledge with
            technical skills in areas like data science, blockchain, and
            artificial intelligence. The sector offers competitive compensation,
            though often with demanding work schedules, particularly in
            investment banking.

            International professionals benefit from the UK's Graduate Route
            visa and the Skilled Worker route, with many financial roles
            qualifying for visa sponsorship. The sector values international
            experience and language skills for serving global clients and
            markets. While London dominates financial employment, regional hubs
            in Edinburgh, Manchester, and Birmingham offer growing opportunities
            with lower living costs and improved work-life balance.
